# Cairngorm for Feathers UI

A port of Cairngorm framework from [Apache Flex](https://flex.apache.org/) (formerly Adobe Flex) to [Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com/) for [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) and [OpenFL](https://openfl.org/).

## What is Cairngorm

The Cairngorm Microarchitecture is a lightweight yet prescriptive framework for Rich Internet application (RIA) development.

Cairngorm is an implementation of design patterns that the consultants at Adobe Consulting have successfully taken from enterprise software development (with technologies including J2EE and .NET) and applied rich Internet application development.

## Minimum Requirements

- Haxe 4.0
- OpenFL 8.9.7
- Feathers UI 1.0

This library is not yet available on Haxelib, so you'll need to install it and its dependencies from Github.
